üåü ## About

Otomato is a professional-grade, no-code automation protocol designed to provide a simple but powerful automation layer for the Web3 ecosystem.

The platform enables users to visually build and deploy autonomous on-chain agents that execute tasks based on predefined triggers and actions.

Our Mission: To remove the technical barriers to Web3 by allowing anyone to automate their on-chain strategies, saving time and maximizing opportunities without writing a single line of code.

üéØ ## Key Features

No-Code Automation Builder: An intuitive drag-and-drop interface where users can connect triggers (like token price changes, low gas fees) with on-chain actions (like swaps, transfers, or contract interactions).

Autonomous On-Chain Agents: Deployable agents powered by secure Smart Accounts (ERC-4337) that operate 24/7 on your behalf.

Developer-Focused SDK: A robust TypeScript SDK for developers to integrate Otomato's automation capabilities directly into their dApps and protocols.

Agent Templates & Marketplace (Future): A future decentralized hub for sharing and monetizing pre-built automation strategies, fostering a community-driven ecosystem.

Multi-Chain Support: Built to be EVM compatible, with initial support for networks like Ethereum, Base, and Oasis Sapphire.

Privacy-Preserving Features: Integrated with partners like iExec to enable privacy-focused automation and alerts.

üó∫Ô∏è ## Roadmap

Phase 1 (Completed): Core Infrastructure & Private Beta ‚Äî Successful deployment of the core automation engine and the launch of our private beta with early users and partners.

Phase 2 (Ongoing): Developer-Ready SDK & Protocol Integrations ‚Äî Providing robust tools for third-party developers and expanding native integrations with major DeFi protocols.

Phase 3 (Planned Q2 2025): Full Public Launch & TGE ‚Äî Launching the platform to the public alongside the planned Token Generation Event.

Phase 4 (Future): Decentralized Agent Marketplace ‚Äî Deploying a marketplace where users can share, discover, and utilize community-built automation templates.
